    <br> try, and definition for overall aesthetic effect. Barbells, dumbbells,

    <br>  similar exercises for sports training and conditioning, general conditioning, and r
    <br>  ehabilitation therapy, see weight training.


    <br> Bodybuilding by the ancient 
    <br> Greeks served as the origin and inspiration for 
    <br> its practice by most 
    <br> later societies. Modern competitions 
    <br> grew largely out of European strongman theatrical and circus acts
    <br>  of the late 19th c
    <br>  entury. The first American physique contest, stage
    <br>  d by physical culturist B
    <br>  ernarr Macfadden (1868–1955), took place in 190
    <br>  3 in New York Cit
    <br>  y. The winner, Al Treloar, was named “The Most Perfectly Dev
    <br>  eloped Man in the World.” Similar contests were held by Macfadden in 1921 and 1922
    <br>  , with Charles Atlas the winner both times. But bodybuilding contests were rare until 
    <br>  the inception of the Mr. America 
    <br>  contest in 1939 under the a
    <br>  uspices of the Amateur Athletic
    <br>   Union (AAU) of the United States. Thereafter, Mr. America winners John Grimek (1940–41) and St
    <br>   eve Reeves (1947) served as role models for a generation of aspiring bodybuilders. The sport d
    <br>   eveloped quickly after World War II, and the
    <br>    AAU Mr. America contest reached the height of its 
    <br>   popularity in the late 1950s and the 1960s. Concurrently there emerged two rival organizations, th
    <br>   e International Federation of BodyBuilders, founded by Canadians Joe and Ben Weider in 1946, and i
    <br>   n Britain the National Amateur Body-Builders’ Association, founded by Oscar Heidenstam in 1950. The 
    <br>   latter’s Mr. Universe contest, staged in London, was the most prestigious international bodybu
    <br>   ilding
    <br>    event for about 25 years. It was surpassed in the 1970s by the Mr. Olympia competition conducted by
    <br>     the Weiders.
    <br> 
    <br> 
    <br> The most important figure in the history of bodybui
    <br> lding is the Austrian-born American bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger, who won the Mr. Olympia title seven times (1970–75, 1980). His awesome physique, winsome personality, and subsequent successful career in films was revolutionary in its impact, fostering a greater acceptance of bodybuilding and fitness-related activities in American society. His Arnold Classic, a physique and fitness gala held annually in Columbus, Ohio, has become a premier event for

    <br> physical culturists. Six-time Ms. Olympia Cory Everson sparked a similar awakening in women’s bodybuilding, which began holding competitions in the 1970s.</p>
