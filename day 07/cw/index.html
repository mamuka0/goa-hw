     <p>Computer programming is the 
       <br> composition of sequences of instructions, called programs, that computers can follow 
      <br>  to perform tasks
       <br> [1][2] It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing code 
       <br> in one or more programming languages. Programmers typically use high-level programming languages that are more easily intelligible to humans 
       <br> than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. Proficient programming usually requires expertise in several 
      <br>  different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, details of programming languages and generic code libraries, specialized 
      <br> algorithms, and formal logic.

<br>Auxiliary tasks accompanying and
 <br>related to programming include analyzing requirements, testing, debugging 
 <br>(investigating and fixing problems), implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts,
  <br>such as programs' machine code. While these are sometimes considered programming, often the term software 
 <br> development is used for this larger 
 <br> overall process – with the terms programming, implementation, 
  <br>and coding reserved for the writing and editing of code per se. Sometimes 
<br>software development is known as software engineering, especially when it employs formal methods or
<br> follows an engineering design process.</p>
